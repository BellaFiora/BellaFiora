Simple node module for parsing osu! database files.

Currently handles `osu!.db`, `collection.db` and `scores.db`.

## Docs
`readOsuDB(path, callback)` calls back with a string `player` and an array of beatmap objects called `beatmaps`.

`readCollectionDB(path, callback)` calls back with an object where the key is the collection name and the value is an array of beatmap md5 hashes.

`writeCollectionDB(path, collections, callback)` writes a collection database file. The `collections` object should be in the same format as in `readCollectionDB`. Be careful.

`readScoresDB(path, callback)` calls back with an object where keys are beatmap md5s and the value is an array containing scores objects.
